This is a Python e-mail bot that sends e-mails to designated receivers.

I got this idea from my deadly cumbersome internship applications.
Sending a single e-mail for every enterprise was a huge and tiring job so,
I decided to make a bot to send my e-mails automatically.
If you are a HR employee, than you guessed right. E-mail that you received
was sended by this bot.

In project folder; Via plaintext.txt and html.html you can set your e-mail as 
to contain a plain text and html or both. Specially, html file really helps me
to support various features. In addition to that; you can send an attachment, if
you specify a file in project folder.

If you write null inside plaintext.txt or int html file, program will not attach
it to the e-mail. My advise is attach both of them to your e-mails. If you wrote
a html formatted text, browser will try to render it first. If it is not successful,
browser will try to render plaintext one.
